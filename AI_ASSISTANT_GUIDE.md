## 🚀 Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click on your profile → "View API Keys"
4. Click "Create new secret key"
5. Name it "3S Tech Website" (optional)
6. Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)
7. **Save it securely** - you can't view it again!

**Cost:** OpenAI charges per token (word). Typical costs:
- 1,000 messages ≈ $0.50 - $2.00 (depending on length)
- Set usage limits in OpenAI dashboard to control costs

### Step 2: Local Development

Create `.env.local` file in project root:

```bash
# .env.local
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-actual-key-here
```

**Important:** This file is already in `.gitignore` and won't be committed to Git.

### Step 3: Test Locally

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally (first time only)
npm install -g vercel

# Run with Vercel dev server (enables API routes)
npm run dev:vercel

# Or use npx without installing
npx vercel dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 (note: port 3000, not 5173)

Click the floating chat button and test!

### Step 4: Deploy to Production

1. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   # If using Git (recommended)
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add AI assistant chatbot"
   git push
   
   # Vercel auto-deploys
   ```

2. **Add API Key to Vercel:**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
   - Click "Add New"
   - Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Value: Your OpenAI API key
   - Environment: Check "Production" (and "Preview" if you want it in preview branches)
   - Click **Save**

3. **Redeploy:**
   - Vercel automatically redeploys when you add environment variables
   - Or manually trigger: Deployments → Latest → Redeploy

**Done!** 🎉 Your AI assistant is live!

- Provides clear, actionable information

**🚫 Should Avoid:**
- Making up pricing without consultation
- Promising unrealistic timelines
- Technical jargon overload
- Being too pushy or sales-y

## 🎨 Customization

### 1. Update System Prompt

Edit `api/chat.js` (lines ~30-80):

```javascript
const systemPrompt = {
  role: 'system',
  content: `You are an AI assistant for 3S Tech Inc...
  
  // Add more details about:
  // - Your team size
  // - Specific industries you serve
  // - Case study highlights
  // - Unique differentiators
  `
}
```

### 2. Change Quick Questions

Edit `src/components/AIChatbot.jsx` (line ~69):

```javascript
const quickQuestions = [
  "How does the migration process work?",
  "What's the typical timeline?",
  "How is AI used in migration?",
  "What about data security?",
  // Add your own!
]
```

### 3. Customize Chat Styling

**Change Colors:**
```jsx
// Primary gradient (button, user messages)
className="bg-gradient-accent"  // Purple → Cyan

// Change to:
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-indigo-600"
```

**Change Size:**
```jsx
// Button size (default: 64px)
className="w-16 h-16"

// Chat window size (default: 400x600)
className="w-[400px] h-[600px]"
```

### 4. Change AI Model

Edit `api/chat.js` (line ~92):

```javascript
body: JSON.stringify({
  model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',  // Fast, affordable
  // Or upgrade to:
  // model: 'gpt-4',        // More accurate, slower, pricier
  // model: 'gpt-4-turbo',  // Best quality
```

**Cost Comparison:**
- `gpt-3.5-turbo`: $0.0015 per 1K tokens (cheapest)
- `gpt-4-turbo`: $0.01 per 1K tokens
- `gpt-4`: $0.03 per 1K tokens

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Track Usage

**OpenAI Dashboard:**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/usage
2. See daily API usage
3. Monitor costs in real-time
4. Set monthly spending limits

**Vercel Logs:**
1. Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Logs
2. See all chat API calls
3. Debug errors if any occur

### Set Spending Limits

**Highly Recommended!**

1. OpenAI Dashboard → Settings → Limits
2. Set "Hard Limit" (e.g., $10/month for starter)
3. Set "Soft Limit" for email alerts
4. API stops when hard limit reached

### Typical Usage

**Expected monthly costs for 3S Tech:**
- 100 conversations/month: ~$5-10
- 500 conversations/month: ~$25-50
- 1,000 conversations/month: ~$50-100

Most small business sites: $10-30/month

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### ✅ What We Did Right

1. **API Key on Server Only**
   - Never exposed in client-side code
   - Stored in environment variables
   - Serverless function handles all OpenAI calls

2. **No Sensitive Data Storage**
   - Chat messages not saved to database
   - No personal info collected without consent
   - Complies with privacy standards

3. **Rate Limiting** (Optional Enhancement)
   - Consider adding rate limits per IP
   - Prevents abuse and cost overruns

### 🚨 Important Warnings

**Never:**
- ❌ Put API key in client-side code
- ❌ Commit `.env.local` to Git
- ❌ Share API key publicly
- ❌ Use same key for dev and production (optional but recommended)

**If Key is Compromised:**
1. Immediately revoke in OpenAI dashboard
2. Create new key
3. Update Vercel environment variables
4. Check usage for suspicious activity

## 🎯 Optimizing Performance

### Response Speed

**Current Setup:** 2-4 seconds per response

**To Improve:**
1. Use `gpt-3.5-turbo` (fastest)
2. Reduce `max_tokens` in `api/chat.js`
3. Keep system prompt concise
4. Use Vercel's edge functions (advanced)

### Cost Optimization

**Tips to Reduce Costs:**
1. Limit conversation history sent to API
2. Use shorter system prompts
3. Set `max_tokens: 300` instead of 500
4. Monitor and adjust based on usage

### User Experience

**Best Practices:**
1. Add typing indicator (already included ✅)
2. Keep responses concise (2-3 paragraphs)
3. Suggest next actions
4. Graceful error handling (already included ✅)

## 📱 Mobile Experience

The chatbot is fully responsive:
- **Desktop:** Fixed bottom-right, 400x600px
- **Tablet:** Slightly smaller, adapts to viewport
- **Mobile:** Near full-screen, easy thumb access

Test on actual devices for best results!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "API key not configured" Error

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env.local` file exists and has correct key
2. Restart dev server after adding .env
3. For production: verify Vercel environment variables
4. Key should start with `sk-`

### Chat Button Appears But No Responses

**Solution:**
1. Open browser console (F12) for errors
2. Check Network tab for API call status
3. Verify API route is deployed: `your-site.com/api/chat`
4. Check Vercel function logs for errors

### "Failed to get response" Message

**Possible Causes:**
1. OpenAI API is down (rare) - check status.openai.com
2. API key invalid or expired
3. Usage limit reached
4. Network connectivity issue

**Solution:**
- Check OpenAI dashboard for account status
- Try regenerating API key
- Verify spending limits not exceeded

### Slow Responses (>10 seconds)

**Causes:**
1. Using gpt-4 (naturally slower)
2. Long conversation history
3. Cold start (first request after inactivity)

**Solution:**
- Switch to gpt-3.5-turbo
- Limit conversation history to last 5 messages
- Accept cold starts (Vercel free tier)

### Chat Doesn't Save Between Page Refreshes

**This is intentional!**
- Chats reset on page reload for privacy
- Users can start fresh conversations
- No database storage needed

**To persist:** Would require backend database (advanced feature)
